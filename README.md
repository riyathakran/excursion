Excursion Project - Codecademy Project (Deploying a Website)

Project Objective as described by Codecademy:

LEARN THE COMMAND LINE AND GIT - Excursion Project In this project,I've created a web page which advertises a product called "Excursion." I've use my growing toolset including HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub. I'll be proud of myself when it all comes together!

The web page we'll build advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences, so we'll use video and landscape imagery to set the scene. A landing page is a vital tool in marketing a product these days, and the goal will be to entice potential customers into using the product.

We'll work with Git and GitHub on our local machines, so if you haven't yet, refer to the articles on Command Line Interface Setup and Git Setup.
